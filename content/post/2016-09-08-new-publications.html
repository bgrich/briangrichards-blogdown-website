<p>I am pleased to (belatedly) announce a pair of publications!</p>
<p>The first is work that I did examining the <a href="http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.93.042505">line shapes of dipole-dipole interactions in a cold Rydberg gas.</a></p>
<p>The second is work done with Tao Zhou on the <a href="http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.93.033407">absence of collective decay in a cold Rydberg gas</a>.</p>
<p>Both of these papers can be found at the links to the APS journal websites above.</p>
