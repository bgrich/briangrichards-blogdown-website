After several years of trying to get it off the ground, I have finally launched 
my blog site. It is called [Simply Approximate](http://www.simplyapproximate.com) 
and will be the home of my rambling thoughts on Data Science, Physics, and any 
other thing that happens to interest me. So if you want to see what I am 
working on, check it out! A permanent link to the blog will be available in 
the sidebar.
