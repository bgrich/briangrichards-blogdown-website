I am pleased to (belatedly) announce a pair of publications!

The first is work that I did examining the [line shapes of dipole-dipole
interactions in a cold Rydberg
gas.](http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.93.042505)

The second is work done with Tao Zhou on the [absence of collective decay
in a cold Rydberg
gas](http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.93.033407).

Both of these papers can be found at the links to the APS journal websites
above.
