I have felt for a while that this site needs a refresh. Previously, I had built 
it using Jekyll on a Windows machine. I've found that Jekyll was a pain to use 
in a Windows environment and that kept me from updating this site 
regularly. Fortunately, a few months ago I attended a RStudio webinar given 
by Yihui Xie on his new [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) 
package. 

Welcome to the new site created in blogdown! It isn't particularly different 
from the previous iteration as it uses a different implementation of the same 
theme from Jekyll ([Hyde](https://github.com/spf13/hyde)). Hopefully, blogdown's 
integration with RStudio will mean that I am more likely to keep the site 
updated. And even better, the RMarkdown integration should let me post code 
alongside any work updates I may post in the future!
