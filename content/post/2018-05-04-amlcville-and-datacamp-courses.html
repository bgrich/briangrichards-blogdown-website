<p>Iâ€™ve been busy over the last few months working on my data science skills. Starting around the beginning of the year, I started working on the DataCamp career track for Data Science using Python. <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/track/697a516dcfd66c1a0da3d900f5d53f6d38bf1b5f">I recently completed it</a> and really enjoyed my time working on it. I feel like the courses have given me enough knowledge that I can do a little bit of work in Python and get started on learning more independently.</p>
<p>I also spent some time back in April at the Charlottesville Applied Machine Learning Conference (AMLCville). <a href="http://www.simplyapproximate.com/posts/amlcville-retrospective/">I wrote up a few quick thoughts on my other blog, so check it out</a>!</p>
