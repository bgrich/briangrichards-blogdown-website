    <p>I’ve been busy over the last few months working on my data science skills. Starting around the beginning of the year, I started working on the DataCamp career track for Data Science using Python. <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/track/697a516dcfd66c1a0da3d900f5d53f6d38bf1b5f">I recently completed it</a> and really enjoyed my time working on it. I feel like the courses have given me enough knowledge that I can do a little bit of work in Python and get started on learning more independently.</p>
<p>I also spent some time back in April at the Charlottesville Applied Machine Learning Conference (AMLCville). <a href="http://www.simplyapproximate.com/posts/amlcville-retrospective/">I wrote up a few quick thoughts on my other blog, so check it out</a>!</p>

    <p>After several years of trying to get it off the ground, I have finally launched my blog site. It is called <a href="http://www.simplyapproximate.com">Simply Approximate</a> and will be the home of my rambling thoughts on Data Science, Physics, and any other thing that happens to interest me. So if you want to see what I am working on, check it out! A permanent link to the blog will be available in the sidebar.</p>

    <p>Another belated announcement! Back in July I defended my dissertation and in August I officially graduated. For any who are interested in the work that I have done, my <a href="https://doi.org/10.18130/V3MB4V">dissertation</a> is freely available from the University of Virginia library.</p>

    <p>I have felt for a while that this site needs a refresh. Previously, I had built it using Jekyll on a Windows machine. I’ve found that Jekyll was a pain to use in a Windows environment and that kept me from updating this site regularly. Fortunately, a few months ago I attended a RStudio webinar given by Yihui Xie on his new <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a> package.</p>
<p>Welcome to the new site created in blogdown! It isn’t particularly different from the previous iteration as it uses a different implementation of the same theme from Jekyll (<a href="https://github.com/spf13/hyde">Hyde</a>). Hopefully, blogdown’s integration with RStudio will mean that I am more likely to keep the site updated. And even better, the RMarkdown integration should let me post code alongside any work updates I may post in the future!</p>

    <p>I am pleased to (belatedly) announce a pair of publications!</p>
<p>The first is work that I did examining the <a href="http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.93.042505">line shapes of dipole-dipole interactions in a cold Rydberg gas.</a></p>
<p>The second is work done with Tao Zhou on the <a href="http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.93.033407">absence of collective decay in a cold Rydberg gas</a>.</p>
<p>Both of these papers can be found at the links to the APS journal websites above.</p>
