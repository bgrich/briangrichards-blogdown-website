      <description>I am pleased to (belatedly) announce a pair of publications!
The first is work that I did examining the line shapes of dipole-dipole interactions in a cold Rydberg gas.
The second is work done with Tao Zhou on the absence of collective decay in a cold Rydberg gas.
Both of these papers can be found at the links to the APS journal websites above.</description>

      <description>I am a data scientist, Physics Ph.D., and R enthusiast interested in the intersection between data science techniques and how these techniques can be used to solve interesting and complex problems. I am particularly interested in developing data acquisition, processing, storage, and analysis pipelines to enable more researchers to easily access complex topics. As part of my Ph.D.Â research I developed a package for R called starkr that is currently available on GitHub.</description>
